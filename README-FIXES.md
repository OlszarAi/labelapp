# LabelApp Fixes for Schema Changes

## Overview

This document describes the fixes implemented to address issues caused by schema changes in the LabelApp project, specifically:

1. Backend database schema change: `LabelElement.size` column was replaced with `fontSize` column
2. Frontend type errors due to missing `rotation` and `properties` fields in LabelElement interfaces

## Background

The application was experiencing 500 errors when:
- Saving labels or elements
- Loading projects with labels
- Accessing labels through API endpoints

These errors were caused by a mismatch between the Prisma client schema and the actual database schema.

## Fixes Implemented

### Backend Fixes

1. **Schema Updates**:
   - Regenerated Prisma client to match the updated database schema
   - Updated import paths to use the newly generated Prisma client

2. **Query Adjustments**:
   - Used explicit field selection in queries to avoid requesting non-existent fields
   - Updated controllers to use `fontSize` instead of `size` when working with text elements

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added better error logging in controllers
   - Implemented fallback logic for handling both `size` and `fontSize` fields during transition

4. **Data Migration**:
   - Created a migration script to ensure all existing records have required fields

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Type Definition Updates**:
   - Updated the `LabelElement` interface in `editor/page.tsx` to include missing `rotation` and `properties` fields
   - Created compatibility utility types to help with future type changes

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created `TYPE_COMPATIBILITY.md` explaining the different type definitions and best practices
   - Added comments explaining changes in code

## Verification

The fixes have been verified by:
- Testing API endpoints that previously returned 500 errors
- Confirming that projects load correctly with their labels and elements
- Ensuring that creating and saving labels with text elements works properly

## Prevention Strategies

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Schema Change Process**:
   - When changing database schema, update all related type definitions
   - Use optional fields initially during transitions
   - Run generated Prisma client in the test environment before production

2. **Type Compatibility Strategy**:
   - Use the created utility types and functions for handling different type definitions
   - Consider consolidating type definitions

## References

- See `SCHEMA_FIX.md` in the backend folder for technical details of the database fix
- See `TYPE_COMPATIBILITY.md` for details about type consistency

## Running the Migration Script

The migration script can be run to update any existing records:

```bash
cd /home/olszar/Documents/work/labelapp_backend
node scripts/update-label-elements.js
```
