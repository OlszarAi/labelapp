# Fabric.js Label Editor Rebuild Plan

## Overview

Complete rebuild of the current DOM-based label editor to use Fabric.js for enhanced performance, better object manipulation, and modern development patterns. This plan is inspired by the adrianhajdin/figma_clone repository and adapts its best practices for our label design needs.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing DOM-Based Editor Issues
- Manual drag/drop implementation (1047+ lines in LabelEditor.tsx)
- Complex zoom and pan logic with transform calculations
- No native undo/redo functionality
- Limited object manipulation capabilities
- Performance issues with large numbers of elements
- Difficult to maintain and extend

### Fabric.js Benefits
- Native object manipulation (drag, resize, rotate)
- Built-in undo/redo system
- Superior canvas performance
- Better event handling
- Extensible object system
- Real-time collaboration support
